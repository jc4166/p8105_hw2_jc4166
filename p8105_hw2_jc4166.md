## Problem 1

The “Mr. Trash Wheel” sheet was read in from the
“HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx” Excel file and variable
names were cleaned. Rows and columns that did not contain
dumpster-specific data were omitted, and for the variable
“sports\_balls” the number was rounded to the nearest integer, and
then converted to an integer variable.

``` r
library(readxl)
mr_trash_wheel_data = read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  subset(dumpster != "NA") %>%
  subset(select = -c(x15)) %>%
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls, digits = 0)))
```

Precipitation data for 2017 and 2018 were read and cleaned, omitting
rows without precipitation data and adding a variable “year”. Then, the
2017 and 2018 precipitation datasets were combined, and “month” was
converted to a character variable.

``` r
library(readxl)
precipitation_2017_data = read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", sheet = "2017 Precipitation", range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  subset(total != "NA") %>%
  mutate(year = "2017")

precipitation_2018_data = read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", sheet = "2018 Precipitation", range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  subset(total != "NA") %>%
  mutate(year = "2018")

precipitation_17_18_combined_data = 
  left_join(precipitation_2017_data, precipitation_2018_data, by = "month") %>%
  mutate(month = month.name[month])
```

The “precipitation\_17\_18\_combined\_data” dataset summarizes
precipitation in inches for each month of 2017 and 2018. The data for
2017 is complete as there are entries for each month, (TRUE, 12
observations total). The data for 2018 is not complete as several months
are missing; there are TRUE, 7 observations total. The total
precipitation for available months in 2018 is XXXX inches. The
“mr\_trash\_wheel\_data” summarizes the types of objects that are
collected by Mr. Trash Wheel. For example, in 2018, XXXX sports balls
were collected in total.

## Problem 2

Data from “pols-month.csv” was read in and cleaned.

``` r
pols_month_data = read_csv(file = "./data/pols-month.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(col = mon, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-") %>%
  mutate(month = month.name[as.numeric(month)]) %>% 
  mutate(president = if_else(prez_gop == 1, "gop", "dem")) %>% 
  select(-prez_gop, -prez_dem, -day)
```

Data from “snp.csv” was read in and cleaned.

``` r
snp_data = read_csv(file = "./data/snp.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(col = date, into = c("month", "day", "year"), sep = "/") %>% 
  select("year", "month", "day", "close") %>% 
  mutate(month = month.name[as.numeric(month)]) %>% 
  select(-day) %>% 
  rename(snp_close = close)
```

Data from “unemployment.csv” was read in and cleaned.

``` r
unemployment_data = read_csv(file = "./data/unemployment.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()

unemployment_data_tidy = 
  pivot_longer(
    unemployment_data,
    jan:dec,
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "percent_unempl") %>% 
  mutate(month = case_when(
    month == "jan" ~ "January",
    month == "feb" ~ "February",
    month == "mar" ~ "March",
    month == "apr" ~ "April",
    month == "may" ~ "May",
    month == "jun" ~ "June",
    month == "jul" ~ "July",
    month == "aug" ~ "August",
    month == "sep" ~ "September",
    month == "oct" ~ "October",
    month == "nov" ~ "November",
    month == "dec" ~ "December"
  ))
```
