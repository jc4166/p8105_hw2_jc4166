## Problem 1

The “Mr. Trash Wheel” sheet was read in from the
“HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx” Excel file and variable
names were cleaned. Rows and columns that did not contain
dumpster-specific data were omitted, and for the variable
“sports\_balls” the number was rounded to the nearest integer, and
then converted to an integer variable.

``` r
library(readxl)
mr_trash_wheel_data = read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  subset(dumpster != "NA") %>%
  subset(select = -c(x15))
```

    ## New names:
    ## * `` -> ...15

Precipitation data for 2017 was read and cleaned, omitting rows without
precipitation data and adding a variable “year”.

``` r
library(readxl)
precipitation_2017_data = read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", sheet = "2017 Precipitation", range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  subset(total != "NA") %>%
  mutate(year = "2017")
```

Precipitation data for 2018 was read and cleaned, omitting rows without
precipitation data and adding a variable “year”.

``` r
library(readxl)
precipitation_2018_data = read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", sheet = "2018 Precipitation", range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  subset(total != "NA") %>%
  mutate(year = "2018")
```

The 2017 and 2018 precipitation datasets were then combined, “month” was
converted to a character variable.
