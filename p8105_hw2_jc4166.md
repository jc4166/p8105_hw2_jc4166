## Problem 1

The “Mr. Trash Wheel” sheet was read in from the
“HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx” Excel file and variable
names were cleaned. Rows and columns that did not contain
dumpster-specific data were omitted, and for the variable
“sports\_balls” the number was rounded to the nearest integer, and
then converted to an integer variable.

``` r
library(readxl)
mr_trash_wheel_data = read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  subset(dumpster != "NA") %>%
  subset(select = -c(x15, x16, x17)) %>%
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls, digits = 0))
```

Precipitation data for 2017 and 2018 were read and cleaned, omitting
rows without precipitation data and adding a variable “year”. Then, the
2017 and 2018 precipitation datasets were combined, and “month” was
converted to a character variable.

``` r
library(readxl)
precipitation_2017_data = read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", sheet = "2017 Precipitation", range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  subset(total != "NA") %>%
  mutate(year = "2017")

precipitation_2018_data = read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", sheet = "2018 Precipitation", range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  subset(total != "NA") %>%
  mutate(year = "2018")

precipitation_17_18_combined_data = 
  left_join(precipitation_2017_data, precipitation_2018_data, by = "month") %>%
  mutate(month = month.name[month])
```

The “precipitation\_17\_18\_combined\_data” dataset summarizes
precipitation in inches for each month of 2017 and 2018. The data for
2017 is complete as there are entries for each month, (TRUE, 12
observations total). The data for 2018 is not complete as several months
are missing; there are TRUE, 12 observations total. The total
precipitation for available months in 2018 is XXXX inches. The
“mr\_trash\_wheel\_data” summarizes the types of objects that are
collected by Mr. Trash Wheel. For example, in 2018, XXXX sports balls
were collected in total.

## Problem 2

Data from “pols-month.csv” was read in and cleaned.

``` r
pols_month_data = read_csv(file = "./data/pols-month.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(col = mon, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-") %>%
  mutate(month = month.name[as.numeric(month)]) %>% 
  mutate(president = if_else(prez_gop == 1, "gop", "dem")) %>% 
  select(-prez_gop, -prez_dem, -day)
```

Data from “snp.csv” was read in and cleaned.

``` r
snp_data = read_csv(file = "./data/snp.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(col = date, into = c("month", "day", "year"), sep = "/") %>% 
  select("year", "month", "day", "close") %>% 
  mutate(month = month.name[as.numeric(month)]) %>% 
  select(-day) %>% 
  rename(snp_close = close)
```

Data from “unemployment.csv” was read in and cleaned.

``` r
unemployment_data = read_csv(file = "./data/unemployment.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(year = as.character(year))

unemployment_data_tidy = 
  pivot_longer(
    unemployment_data,
    jan:dec,
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "percent_unempl") %>% 
  mutate(month = case_when(
    month == "jan" ~ "January",
    month == "feb" ~ "February",
    month == "mar" ~ "March",
    month == "apr" ~ "April",
    month == "may" ~ "May",
    month == "jun" ~ "June",
    month == "jul" ~ "July",
    month == "aug" ~ "August",
    month == "sep" ~ "September",
    month == "oct" ~ "October",
    month == "nov" ~ "November",
    month == "dec" ~ "December"
  ))
```

Data from snp was merged into pols to form pols\_snp\_data, and then
unemployment was merged into pols\_snp\_data to form
pols\_snp\_unemployment\_data.

``` r
pols_snp_data = 
  left_join(pols_month_data, snp_data, by = c("year", "month"))

pols_snp_unemployment_data = 
  left_join(pols_snp_data, unemployment_data_tidy, by = c("year", "month"))
```

The pols\_snp\_unemployment\_data dataset contains merged data from the
pols\_month, snp, and unemployment datasets. Each of the datasets had
information delineated by dates, which was cleaned into “year” and
“month” variables to be able to merge the datasets. pols\_month had
counts for the number of national politicians (governors, senators,
representatives) of each party (gop or democrat) for each year and month
from January 1947 to June 2015, and whether the president was gop or
democrat. The snp dataset has the closing values of the S\&P stock index
by date from January 1950 to July 2015. The unemployment dataset has the
percent unemployment for each month and year from January 1948 to
December 2015. The resulting merged dataset
(pols\_snp\_unemployment\_data) is a tibble with 11 variables and 822
observations, though there is missing snp data from 1947 to 1949 and
missing unemployment data from 1947. The data is otherwise complete
until June 2015.

## Problem 3

Data from Popular\_Baby\_Names.csv was read in and cleaned.

``` r
baby_names_tidy = read.csv(file = "./data/Popular_Baby_Names.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(name = child_s_first_name) %>% 
  rename(year = year_of_birth) %>% 
  mutate(name = tolower(name)) %>% 
  mutate(gender = tolower(gender)) %>% 
  mutate(ethnicity = tolower(ethnicity)) %>% 
  mutate(ethnicity = case_when(
    ethnicity == "asian and pacific islander" ~ "Asian and Pacific Islander",
    ethnicity == "asian and paci" ~ "Asian and Pacific Islander",
    ethnicity == "black non hispanic" ~ "Black Non-Hispanic",
    ethnicity == "black non hisp" ~ "Black Non-Hispanic",
    ethnicity == "white non hispanic" ~ "White Non-Hispanic",
    ethnicity == "white non hisp" ~ "White Non-Hispanic",
    ethnicity == "hispanic" ~ "Hispanic"
  )) %>% 
  distinct()
```

Create a table showing the rank in popularity of the name “Olivia” over
time.

``` r
name_olivia = baby_names_tidy %>% 
  select(year, ethnicity, name, rank) %>% 
  filter(name == "olivia")
```

To make the above table easier to view, I will “untidy” it for
presentation. This table will show the year, and the rank of the name
“Olivia” in each ethnicity category.

``` r
olivia_rank =
  pivot_wider(
    name_olivia,
    names_from = "year",
    values_from = "rank"
  ) %>% 
  select(-name) %>% 
  select ("ethnicity", "2011", "2012", "2013", "2014", "2015", "2016")
```

Rank in popularity of male names for white non-hsipanic children in
2016.

``` r
male_wnh_2016 = baby_names_tidy %>% 
  filter(
    year == "2016",
    gender == "male",
    ethnicity == "White Non-Hispanic"
         ) %>% 
  select(-year, -gender, -ethnicity)
```

Plot of male\_wnh\_2016 data.

``` r
ggplot(male_wnh_2016, aes(x = rank, y = count)) + 
  geom_point()
```
